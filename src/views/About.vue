    <p>The SFHS Invent-Team is developing an accessory that will make females between the ages of 13-19 feel a lot safer in their own community. This accessory will include a variety of components that allow them to call for help under ominous situations when they might need it most. The invention will be instrumental in getting her the help she needs if she ever finds herself in a dangerous situation. By pressing the alert button
    on her accessory, she will trigger an alert message that will be shared
    with her emergency contacts and/or law enforcement that includes her GPS location. For many young people, their privacy is very important which is why our device will only deliver the GPS location when the alert button is pressed. If the button isn’t pressed, the GPS location will not be shared, ensuring their privacy remains intact. In addition, when the button is pressed, a hidden camera will record what the young female is experiencing.
    The recording will be saved and sent to law enforcement for further investigation. The device will be powered by renewable energy so that they will be able to charge the device anywhere they might be, whether they have an outlet around or not. All of these components will be disguised as an accessory, therefore the perpetrator will have no idea
    that the young female is calling for help.</p>

    <p>The SFHS Invent Team is an all-female group made up of 24 students in grades 9-12. The females are students at San Fernando High School (SFHS)
    and have demonstrated excellent leadership, critical thinking and problem-solving skills, among other qualities which enhance the team’s performance. Most team members have background experience in coding or are enrolled in a Computer Science class, a skill the team will put into
    practice while creating the project. Most of the girls have participated in Engineering Dynamics class at SFHS, in which we learned about 3D design, electrical engineering, programing using Arduinos, soldering, sewing, and
    coding.</p>

        <p>
            As an all-female Invent-Team living in the San Fernando Valley, many of us have experienced discomfort by the mere thought of walking home after practice in the late afternoon. Women and young girls should feel safe in
            their community and our device will ggit pushive them an added level of security
            they’ve never had before. With the alarming occurrences we hear on the
            news about young women being abducted for sex-trafficking, rape, or
            torture, we are concerned that at any moment, that young girl on the
            news could be one of us. Feeling safer when we walk home from school, or
            even simply spending time in our own community, will allow us to continue
            with our day-to-day life giving us the opportunity to grow.
